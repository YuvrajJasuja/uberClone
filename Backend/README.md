## POST /users/register

Description
---------

Register a new user. This endpoint validates the incoming payload (username, email and password) and creates a user record.

Mount Point
---------

POST /users/register

Headers
-------

- Content-Type: `application/json`

Request body
------------

The endpoint expects a JSON body with the following fields:

- `email` (string) — required, must be a valid email address
- `password` (string) — required, minimum length 6 characters
- `username` (string) — required by the user model, should be a non-empty string (trimmed).

Example request
---------------

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

Responses (common)
------------------

- 201 Created — User successfully registered. Response body will come from the controller (typically includes created user or auth token depending on implementation).
- 400 Bad Request — Validation failed. Express-validator will return an errors array describing which fields failed (e.g., invalid email, password too short).
- 409 Conflict — (Optional) Email already exists — if the controller checks for duplicates and uses this code.
- 500 Internal Server Error — Unexpected server error.

Notes
-----

- The validation rules are implemented in `Backend/routes/user.routes.js` using `express-validator` (see `body("email").isEmail()` , `body("password").isLength({ min: 6 })` and `body('username').trim().notEmpty().withMessage('username is required')`).
- Ensure you start the server from the `Backend` folder or load your `.env` properly (dotenv is required in `Backend/app.js`).

## POST /users/login

Description
---------

Authenticate an existing user and receive an authentication token.


Request body
------------

The endpoint expects a JSON body with the following fields:

- `email` (string) — required, must be a valid email address
- `password` (string) — required, minimum length 6 characters

Example request
---------------

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

Responses
---------

- 200 OK — Login successful. Response includes:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "JWT_TOKEN_STRING",
    "user": {
      // User object (password excluded)
    }
  }
  ```
- 400 Bad Request — Cases:
  - Validation failed (invalid email format or password too short)
  - Invalid credentials (email not found or password doesn't match)
  - Response includes either validation errors array or `{"message": "invalid credentials"}`
- 500 Internal Server Error — Unexpected server error

Notes
-----

- Password is compared using bcrypt (see `Backend/models/user.js`)
- JWT token is generated using the user's ID and `JWT_SECRET` from environment variables
- The returned user object will not include the password field (Mongoose schema has `select: false` for password)
- The token is also set as an HTTP-only cookie named "token"
